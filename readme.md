I would like to sincerely thank GitHub for generously providing access to their Codespaces feature for free, which has been instrumental in building this Minecraft server.

This server was developed entirely by me, Stanislaus Anandito, an undergraduate student at UPNVJ majoring in Information Systems. As someone passionate about technology and game development, this project has been a rewarding way to combine both interests.

The primary purpose of this server is to create a virtual space where my friends and I can come together and hang out.
